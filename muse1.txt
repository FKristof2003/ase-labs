Tell how he wandered, Muse, time and again
confounded, after he sacked Troy's citadel,
how many towns he saw and learned their ways,
how many trials the man endured at sea
to save his comrades' lives, return them home.
Hard though he tried, he failed to save those men
whose recklessness secured their own demise.
Like fools they ate the sun god Helios' cows,
and he made certain they would not survive.
